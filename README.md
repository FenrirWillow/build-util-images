## Builds

Tag | Node version | Terraform Version

## Using the build images

TLDR: `docker pull fenrirwillow/build-util-images:<tag>`

The images contain the specified Node and Terraform version along with a few utilities (curl, unzip). They also contain the minimal native compiler toolchain via the `build-essential` package for building things like native Node modules.
